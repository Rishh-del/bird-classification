Bird Species Classification-

Developed a Bird Species Classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project includes comprehensive preprocessing (resizing, normalization, class balancing), exploratory dimensionality reduction via PCA, and training a custom CNN model. Achieved ~28% accuracy and highlighted key areas for improvement including data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and potential for transfer learning.

📊 Tools: TensorFlow, Keras, PCA
🐦 Input: Bird images (resized to 224x224)
🎯 Output: Predicted species classification

🚀 Future Scope: Integrate pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet), optimize evaluation metrics, and scale dataset for better accuracy.
